# timeLapse
The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.

TimeLapse is a pomodoro clock that allocates a user to allocate a 25 minutes of work time 5 minutes short-break, and after four rounds gives a long-break of 15 minutes.
Pomodoro technique is a great way to beat procastination and can be used for studying, writing or any other task.
